  <p><em>Empowering businesses with free, open-source tools for growth</em></p>
</div>

## 🌟 Vision

OpenSuite aims to democratize business software by creating a comprehensive, integrated ecosystem of open-source business applications. Our vision is to lower the barrier to entry for startups and SMBs by providing enterprise-grade tools without the enterprise price tag.

We believe that businesses shouldn't have to choose between expensive proprietary solutions or cobbling together disconnected open-source alternatives. OpenSuite offers a unified platform that grows with your business - from day one to enterprise scale.

## 🎯 Mission

To create and maintain a fully-featured, open-source business platform that:
- Empowers startups to launch quickly with minimal IT investment
- Provides a cohesive user experience across all business functions
- Scales seamlessly from small business to enterprise needs
- Gives organizations full control of their data and processes
- Creates a community of contributors who benefit from and enhance the platform

## 📊 Project Overview

OpenSuite is a true microservices ecosystem with a centralized identity management approach. Each business function is implemented as a separate service with its own database, but united through:

1. **Single identity management** for seamless user experience
2. **Consistent UI/UX** across all applications
3. **Standardized API design** for interoperability
4. **Event-driven architecture** for real-time data flow
5. **Containerized deployment** for scalability and resilience

## 🧩 Core Components

### Identity Management Layer
- **identity_engine**: Central user management system with authentication, authorization, and single sign-on
- **identity_frontend**: Administrative interface for user provisioning and permission management

### Core Portal Layer
- **home_engine**: Core service that provides navigation and integration points
- **home_frontend**: User dashboard that serves as the entry point to all applications

### Business Applications Layer

| Module | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| **ERP** | Accounting, inventory, purchasing (similar to ERPNext) | Planned |
| **HRM** | Employee management, departments, benefits, time tracking | Planned |
| **CRM** | Customer relationships, sales pipeline, lead management | Planned |
| **Collaboration** | File sharing, real-time document editing, meetings | Planned |
| **Support** | Knowledge base, helpdesk ticketing, support chat | Planned |
| **IT Management** | Asset management, service catalog, infrastructure | Planned |

## 🏗️ Architecture

OpenSuite is built on a modern technology stack designed for scalability, performance, and developer experience:

- **Backend**: TypeScript with Hono.js for lightweight, performant APIs
- **Frontend**: React and Next.js for robust, user-friendly interfaces
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for reliable, scalable data storage
- **ORM**: Drizzle for type-safe database access
- **Build System**: Turborepo for monorepo management
- **Runtime**: Bun for high-performance JavaScript execution
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent deployments
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with centralized identity management

### Key Architectural Principles

1. **Decoupled Services**: Each microservice has its own dedicated database and processing logic
2. **Independent Frontends**: Each service has its own UI that can evolve independently
3. **Centralized Identity**: Single source of truth for users, with fine-grained permission control
4. **Service Independence**: Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
5. **Unified User Experience**: Despite being separate applications, users experience a cohesive platform
